# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Preform exploratory analysis to understand the relationships between type of city, number of drivers, and number of riders. Using this data to build insights that will inform strategies around accessibility and affordability in an upcoming meeting with PyBer CEO V. Isualize. 

## Results

### Analysis by City Type

Population density is a big factor for both the customer and employee PyBer experience:
 - Customers in rural areas can expect to pay, on average, 41% more than customers in urban area. While that can be expected when you need a driver to take you a longer distance, it can limit usage of our services in rural areas.
 - Employees in rural areas can expect to make, on average, 235% more from each customer in urban areas but these drivers can expect a much lower ride volume.

## Summary

To retain our at-risk customers and employees, we need to target improvements in rural areas to drive customer adoption of PyBer services. The data shows customers in rural areas pay on average 41% more than customers in urban areas and while our drivers make a much higher fare per customer, the limited ride volume has a significant impact on their total compensation. We have the following business recommendations to address the disparities among our city types:
-	Realign fares pricing structure in rural areas, incorporating estimated efficiencies gained by increased gas mileage with longer distances and less frequent stops.
-	Increase customer marketing in rural areas highlighting the customer focused change made for “Hard working people like you/us, in rural areas.”
-	Review trends one month post change to understand results of change. Did we increase penetration in rural areas? Did this increase ride volume? Did this increase total compensation for our drivers?
