## Results

### Analysis by City Type

Population density is a big factor for both the customer and employee PyBer experience:
 - Customers in rural areas can expect to pay, on average, 41% more than customers in urban area. While that can be expected when you need a driver to take you a longer distance, it can limit usage of our services in rural areas.
 - Employees in rural areas can expect to make, on average, 235% more from each customer in urban areas but these drivers can expect a much lower ride volume.
